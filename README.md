##### Other stuff 
 
Here's one that looks at using the mahalanobis distance as a replacement for tf-idf
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08493
If you pick this, I can help you understand the papers and the equations. You can apply this to specific domains.
Here's a corpus of research papers
https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/
If you're interested in this, I can give you the files I used to parse the data so you can go straight into model building and training.
Another research papers database
https://aminer.org/open-academic-graph
This is also a great database for text data based on research papers, which I don't think people have done any real ml projects on, the arxiv database
https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data
I recommend just focusing on a few areas, for example arxiv-sanity just extracts cs.[CV|CL|LG|AI|NE]/stat.ML papers.
One cool idea is to apply some SOA architecture (elmo, bert, bi-lstm+attention) to the text in these datasets.
Another idea is to apply CNN's to these texts, 1 dimension is the text itself, the 2nd dimension is the word embeddings of the texts. Not too much has been done but it seems very promising.
Implementing the architecture in any of the resources below would also be a great project.
